U-turns are illegal at signalised intersections in all States and Territories except Victoria, unless a *U-turn permitted* sign is displayed. Less than 10 per cent of signalised intersections in these jurisdictions permit these movements, and [debate remains on whether they should be allowed](http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/publications/researchreports/CASR017.pdf).

### The situation in Victoria

U-turns are permitted at all intersections unless a *no U-turn* sign is displayed ([Reg 40](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2017208/s40.html) and [Reg 41](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2017208/s41.html)). The *U-turn permitted* sign is generally not used in Victoria.

<!--![Driving performing a U-turn at an intersection](/images/2020-05/U-turn-at-intersection.png)-->

The rules on giving way are quite clear cut for pedestrians crossing the road and vehicles travelling through or turning in an intersection.
> **[ROAD SAFETY ROAD RULES 2017 - REG 38](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2017208/s38.html)**
>
> **Giving way when making a U-turn**
>
> A driver making a U-turn must give way to all vehicles and pedestrians.

But what about those turning left at a slip lane? The slip lane is further along the road, and vehicles in the slip lane must give way to vehicles on the road, right?

<img src="/images/2020-05/UTurnGiveWayNoColour.svg" alt="U-turn vs slip lane" height="400" width="400" />

#### The road rules

[Reg 62](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2017208/s62.html) states that those turning right do not need to give way to vehicles turning left at a slip lane, but no mention is made on U-turns.

Digging deeper into the regulations, [Reg 67](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2017208/s67.html) and [Reg 69](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2017208/s69.html) provide more clarity on these situations.

> **[ROAD SAFETY ROAD RULES 2017 - REG 69](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2017208/s69.html)**
>
> **Giving way at a give way sign or give way line at an intersection (except a roundabout)**
>
> (3A)     If the driver is turning left using a slip lane, the driver must give way to—
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) any vehicle on the road the driver is entering, or turning right at the intersection into the road the driver is entering **(except a vehicle making a U-turn at the intersection)**; and
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any other vehicle or pedestrian on the slip lane.

**So vehicles u-turning must give way to all other vehicles and pedestrians, including to vehicles turning left from a slip lane.**

#### In practice

*U-turn must give way* signs are commonly posted at intersections -- these are Victoria specific signs not used anywhere else in the country. VicRoads provides guidance on the use of these signs in the [TEM Vol 2 Part 2.14](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/-/media/files/technical-documents-new/traffic-engineering-manual-v2/tem-vol-2-part-214--as174214-traffic-signals.ashx).

> Clause 6.1 – SIGNS
>
> Sign R2-V115 U TURN MUST GIVE WAY should not be used at intersections simply to support the road rule.
>
> The sign is used at signalised intersections that have a green right turn arrow on the major road operating concurrently with a green left turn arrow on the side road.

*Note the slip lanes and zoom in closer to the median strip to see the U-turn must give way sign.*

The examples above all have *U-turn must give way* signs at locations where slip lanes are present, not conforming with the VicRoads TEM. This could indicate that the community has a poor understanding of give way rules when U-turning, and where these signs are not displayed, there may be high non-compliance increasing the likelihood of an incident occurring. 

If these signs are needed to enforce a rule which otherwise would have been ignored, perhaps the rules are not widely understood, confusing or impracticable, and in need of change.

##### Some more interesting cases

Credit to VicRoads for installing a *no U-turn* sign to avoid U-turners giving way to three lanes of turning traffic in the middle of an intersection.

In the examples above, the slip lanes are around 20 metres away from the intersections. Reg 69 of the Road Safety Road Rules still suggests that vehicles U-turning must give way -- I doubt this ever happens here in practice.
